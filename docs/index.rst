CodeGrade Emacs Plugin
======================================

Even though the CodeGrade filesystem works together with any editor by manually
editing its special files, it is recommended to use it in combination with
editor plugins. CodeGrade offers a plugin for the
`Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__ editor. This plugin is
also known as *CodeGra.el*.
