CodeGrade Emacs Plug-in
======================================

Even though the CodeGrade filesystem works together with any editor by manually
editing its special files, it is recommended to use it in combination with
editor plugins. CodeGrade offers a plugin for the
`Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__ editor. This plugin is
also known as *CodeGra.el*.

The code of the CodeGrade Emacs Plug-in is open-source and can be found on
`Github <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.el>`__.
